# Starter project and easy start-up for Decentraland developments

This is a custom modification of another Github repository dedicated to developing your environments and experiences into Decentraland. You can find the original repository by Fairwood here: https://github.com/fairwood/DecentralandUnityPlugin#readme

In this readme.md below this line is explained all the modified features made to this plug-in and explained our created custom tools one by one. This readme shall get updated each time a major update has been done with new or modified features.

## Description

*"Create, explore and trade in the first-ever virtual world owned by its users."* With this welcoming sentence Decentraland invite us to dive into one of the first blockchain-backed platform that enhances an alternate reality to express our ideas and projects into the world. 

Launched in February 2020, Decentraland has seen its potential grow exponentially as different blockchain-related companies and projects have placed a headquarter or contact point to connect bridges with their audience among the metaverse.

This plugin focuses into creating an easy environment for artists and new-users that are not used at all into hardcoding but have a  basic knowledge of code behaviour and debugging.
Decentraland runs a mix a Unity (c#) with Typescript and JavaScript, so it's better if you have a previous experience with any of these languages.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
* The project does not need the SDK to run, but it's extremely recommendable to do local deploys of your project. You can find it here: [Decentraland Docs](https://docs.decentraland.org/development-guide/SDK-101/); and you can find a local-deploy step-by-step guide here: [Local-Deploy Guide](https://www.notion.so/polygonalmind/Local-deploy-of-a-Decentraland-Project-1a9fbbc0d9614b119d5d675aa9e0f788)

* The project should run on Unity 2018.x perfectly fine. To match our development conditions, use 2018.3.6f1. Install via Unity Hub: unityhub://2018.3.6f1/a220877bc173

#### Installing
Once you have your Unity version installed, just open the project folder with it and you will be done to start developing your experiences.
